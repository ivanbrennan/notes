Both bats and pterosaurs can (or [em]could[/em] fly). Each evolved a similar [wing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Homology.jpg) independently. This is an example of [convergent evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution), the "independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages".

In Ruby, classes allow you to group objects into a lineage, with child classes inheriting features from their ancestors. Modules, on the other hand, allow unrelated classes to share functionality. Let's consider flight:

``` ruby
module Wing
  def fly
    puts "A #{self.class} is flying."
  end
end

class Bat
  include Wing

  def echolocate
    puts "A #{self.class} can see in the dark."
  end
end

class Pterosaur
  include Wing
end

bert = Bat.new
bert.fly
# => "A Bat is flying."

phil = Pterosaur.new
phil.fly
# => "A Pterosaur is flying."
```

Contrast this with sharing functionality via classes. Let's create a couple species of bat by defining descendents of the Bat class:

``` ruby
class SeminoleBat < Bat
end

class CanyonBat < Bat
end

sam = SeminoleBat.new
sam.echolocate
# => "A SeminoleBat can see in the dark."

cammy = CanyonBat.new
cammy.echolocate
# => "A CanyonBat can see in the dark."
```

Both `sam` and `cammy` can echolocate, since both `SeminoleBat` and `CanyonBat` are descendents of the `Bat` class. Features defined in `Bat` are inherited by `SeminoleBat` and `CanyonBat`. But `Pterosaur` is unrelated to `Bat`, and cannot echolocate.

``` ruby
phil.echolocate
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `echolocate' for #<Pterosaur:0x007fdcbc082eb0>
```

There is a bit more to Modules (they can be used to define class methods as well as instance methods, and they can include constants), but the general purpose they serve is to enable sharing functionality across unrelated classes.
