sequel gem is somewhat database agnostic
  it will handle whichever database we're using
  sqlite gem communicates between ruby and sqlite

  ruby -> sequel gem -> sqlite gem -> sqlite database

same could be said for datamapper:
  ruby -> datamapper gem -> sqlite gem -> sqlite database

File.dirname(__FILE__) # get current file and return the name of parent directory

require 'rack/test'
set :environment, :test

def app
  Sinatra::Application
end

describe 'Reverse Service' do
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  it "should load the home page" do
    get '/'
    last_response.should be_ok
  end
end
