github is a repository of repositories

merging feature branch into master branch
  --discards commit history and just shoves latest version of feature branch into master

git add
  --if itâ€™s a directory, adds all the files in that directory recursively

pull request: master (to) compare(from)

over-communicate
organization
	analog solutions ;)

add and commit separate: granularity

merge occurs automatically on commit once all conflicts resolved

commit message: first line (title), blank line, more thorough description

keep branches small as possible (remerge often)

git checkout HEAD (HEAD -> most recent commit)

git reset --hard HEAD (discard changes and rollback to most recent commit)

best practice for fork to track upstream
