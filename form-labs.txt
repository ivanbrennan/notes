hit submit: build http request and send get/post 

  get request:  header, params are placed in the query string
  post request: params placed in body

  action determines the route

route starting with '/' is absolute path

'back' button doesn't generate new request

submit made post request, server said to redirect,
so the client made new request, server responded

reloader won't pick up changes to html (just to requests)

route order: specific to general

class instance persists for the life of the route

erb partials
<%= erb :'layouts/_header' %>

destroy from link: get request
if p.save
p.update(request.params)

===============
sinatra route parameters are accessible via the params hash, not directly
  get '/pigeons/:id'
    Pigeon.get(params[:id].to_i)
    # NOT Pigeon.get(:id)
  end
