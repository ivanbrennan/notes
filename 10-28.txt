================
deploying an app
================
virtualization
  isolation (except some hardware issues)

    independent os and everything

ubuntu lts 12.04

digitalocean
  ssh root@...

    useradd -s /bin/bash -G sudo -m ivan
    passwd ivan
    exit
    ssh ivan@...

  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
